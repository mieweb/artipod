# weighbridge

**The scale your npm package crosses before it ships.**

Every package your users install has a *curb weight* — what their app carries before it loads any cargo of its own: the tarball on disk, the bytes their bundler ships to browsers, the milliseconds and megabytes burned just `import`ing you. Nobody adds 400 KB on purpose. It arrives one "small" dependency and one "temporary" re-export at a time, and by the time someone opens an issue about it, it's load-bearing.

weighbridge is a CI gate that weighs your package on every PR and refuses to let an overweight load leave the yard.

```text
ok   pack tarball: 4.13 MB (budget 4.77 MB)
ok   bundle . gzip: 594.2 KB (budget 654.3 KB) — min 1.99 MB
ok   bundle ./tools gzip: 12.4 KB (budget 15.6 KB) — min 39.9 KB
ok   import .: 101 ms (budget 700 ms) — rss 97.44 MB (report-only)
ok   cmd cli --help: 127 ms (budget 800 ms)

All weight limits met — cleared to ship.
```

## What it weighs

| Measurement | How | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| **Shipping weight** — tarball, unpacked size, per-directory sections | `npm pack --dry-run` | Accidentally published assets, doc/type bloat, a demo UI riding along in `files` |
| **Curb weight** — min+gzip bundle per export entry | esbuild (pinned version), your externals | A dependency that doubles what every browser app ships |
| **Cold start** — fresh-process `import()` time (median of 3) + RSS | plain `node` child processes | A lazy import someone made eager; module-graph creep |
| **CLI startup** — any command you name | timed spawn | Slow `--help`, slow `npx yourtool` first impressions |

One zero-dependency Node script. No framework, no config DSL — a JSON file of limits.

## Adopt it in three steps

**1. Add `weighbridge.json`** next to your `package.json` — your export entries, your weight limits (current measurement + ~10% headroom is a good start):

```jsonc
{
  "esbuild": { "version": "0.25.0", "platform": "browser", "external": ["react", "react-dom"] },
  "pack": {
    "maxTarballBytes": 5000000,
    "sections": { "dist": { "prefix": "dist/", "maxBytes": 3300000 } }
  },
  "entries": [
    { "name": ".",       "path": "dist/index.js",       "maxGzipBytes": 670000, "maxImportMs": 700 },
    { "name": "./tools", "path": "dist/tools/index.js", "maxGzipBytes": 16000,  "maxImportMs": 150 }
  ],
  "commands": [
    { "name": "cli --help", "command": ["node", "dist/cli.js", "--help"], "maxMs": 800 }
  ]
}
```

**2. Add the action** to your CI after install + build:

```yaml
- uses: mieweb/artipod/.github/actions/weighbridge@main
```

**3. Run it locally** whenever you're curious:

```jsonc
// package.json
"scripts": { "weighbridge": "node .github/actions/weighbridge/weighbridge.mjs" }
```

Over a limit? The job fails with exactly which metric and by how much. Either shrink the change — or raise the limit *in the same PR*, where a reviewer sees the weight increase as a conscious, diffable decision instead of silent drift.

## Trending: PRs, main, and releases

The [reference workflow](../../workflows/weighbridge.yml) adds history on top of the gate:

- **Every PR** gets a job-summary table with a **Δ-vs-main column** per metric (the latest main run's report is fetched as the baseline) — reviewers see "+3.2 KB gzip on `./tools`" right in the check, before merge.
- **Every main push and release** appends one weigh-in row to `weigh-ins.jsonl` on a dedicated **`weigh-ins` branch** — permanent, diffable history (workflow artifacts expire after 90 days; a branch doesn't). Release rows carry the tag, so version-over-version trends are a one-liner:

```bash
git show origin/weigh-ins:weigh-ins.jsonl \
  | jq -r 'select(.event=="release") | [.ref, .metrics["pack tarball"], .metrics["bundle . gzip"]] | @tsv'
```

## Config reference

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `esbuild.version` | Pinned esbuild version (reproducible weigh-ins) |
| `esbuild.platform` / `esbuild.external` | Global bundling defaults; also settable per entry |
| `pack.maxTarballBytes` / `pack.maxUnpackedBytes` | Limits on `npm pack` output |
| `pack.sections.<name>` | `{ prefix, maxBytes? }` — per-directory shipping weight (e.g. gate `dist/` tightly while a bundled UI is only reported) |
| `entries[]` | `{ name, path, maxGzipBytes?, maxImportMs?, platform?, external? }` — omit a limit to skip that measurement |
| `commands[]` | `{ name, command: [argv...], maxMs }` |

Flags: `--config <path>` (default `weighbridge.json`), `--write-baseline` (snapshot current numbers into `weighbridge-baseline.json` for local Δ comparison).

Any metric without a limit is **report-only** — measured, tabled, trended, never failing. RSS after import is always report-only (too runner-noisy to gate).

## Notes

- Runs **after** your build; it weighs `dist/`, not `src/`.
- Time limits should be generous (2–3× your laptop): CI runners are slow and shared. The gzip numbers are deterministic — make those the tight ones.
- `npm pack --dry-run` triggers your `prepare` script (typically a rebuild) — harmless in CI where you just built, a few extra seconds locally.
- Needs `permissions: contents: write` (weigh-ins branch) and `actions: read` (PR baseline) only in the workflow; the action itself needs nothing.

*Know the weight of your empty container — and never let it grow by accident.*
